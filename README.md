LEAD-DBS
========

LEAD-DBS is ***NOT*** intended for clinical use!

## About Lead-DBS

LEAD-DBS is a MATLAB toolbox facilitating the:

- reconstruction of deep-brain-stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the human brain on basis of postoperative MRI and/or CT imaging
- the visualization of localization results in 2D/3D
- a group-analysis of DBS-electrode placement results and their effects on clinical results
- simulation of DBS stimulations (calculation of volume of activated tissue – VAT)
- diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based connectivity estimates and fiber-tracking from the VAT to other brain regions (connectomic surgery)

## Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Recommended RAM size: 32GB or more
- MATLAB version: R2022b or later

#### Normal installation

Lead-DBS can be downloaded from our [website](https://www.lead-dbs.org) in fully functional form.

#### Development installation

Alternatively, especially in case you wish to modify and contribute to Lead-DBS, you can

- Make sure to meet the prerequisites
- Clone the Lead-DBS repository from [github](https://github.com/netstim/leaddbs.git).
- Download the necessary [data](https://www.lead-dbs.org/release/download.php?id=data_pcloud) and unzip it into the cloned git repository.

We’d love to implement your improvements into Lead-DBS – please contact us for direct push access to Github or feel free to add pull-requests to the Lead-DBS repository.

## Getting started

You can run Lead-DBS by typing "lead demo" into the Matlab prompt. This will open up the main GUI and a 3D viewer with an example patient.
But there's much more to explore. Head over to our [website](https://www.lead-dbs.org) to see a walkthrough tutorial, a manual, some more screenshots and other ressources. There's also a helpline in form of a Slack channel. We would love to hear from you.
